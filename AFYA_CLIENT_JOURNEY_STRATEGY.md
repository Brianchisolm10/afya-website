# AFYA Client Journey & Differentiation Strategy

## The Core Problem You've Identified

You're absolutely right to question the current flow. Here are the issues:

1. **Redundancy**: Why take assessments on the public site if they'll get them all again in the portal?
2. **Overwhelm**: Too many intake forms creates decision fatigue
3. **Lack of Differentiation**: Feels like "just another program website"
4. **Fragmented Experience**: Clients shouldn't need to return to the public site for tools

## Recommended Strategy: Progressive Engagement Model

### Phase 1: PUBLIC SITE (Marketing & Discovery)
**Goal**: Build trust, educate, and capture interest

**What Stays Public**:
1. **Health Tools** (Current /tools page)
   - Keep these as FREE educational resources
   - No login required
   - Purpose: Demonstrate AFYA's expertise and build trust
   - These are "taste tests" - not assessments

2. **Single Simplified Intake** → "Discovery Call Request"
   - Replace all specific program intakes with ONE form
   - Questions:
     - Name, email, phone
     - "What brings you to AFYA?" (open text)
     - "What are you hoping to achieve?" (open text)
     - "When would you like to start?" (dropdown)
     - Optional: "How did you hear about us?"
   - This generates a lead, not a packet
   - Admin reviews and schedules discovery call

**What Gets Removed from Public**:
- All the specific program intake forms (nutrition, training, youth, etc.)
- These move to the client portal AFTER they become a client

---

### Phase 2: DISCOVERY CALL (Human Touch)
**Goal**: Understand needs, build relationship, recommend path

**Process**:
1. Admin/Coach reviews discovery form
2. Schedules 15-30 min call
3. During call:
   - Understand client's goals, challenges, lifestyle
   - Explain AFYA's approach and philosophy
   - Recommend appropriate program(s)
   - Discuss pricing and commitment
4. If client agrees → Create account and assign program

**Why This Matters**:
- Personal connection (not just another website)
- Proper program matching (not self-selection)
- Higher conversion (human touch)
- Better client outcomes (right program from start)

---

### Phase 3: CLIENT PORTAL (Personalized Experience)
**Goal**: Deliver customized coaching and track progress

**First Login Experience**:
1. Welcome message from their assigned coach
2. "Let's get to know you better" - ONE comprehensive intake
   - This is the REAL assessment
   - Tailored to their assigned program
   - More detailed than public form
   - Generates their personalized packet

**Ongoing Portal Features**:
- View/download their personalized packet
- Access to ALL health tools (same as public, but tracked)
- Progress tracking dashboard
- Communication with coach
- Program-specific resources
- Ability to request additional assessments if needs change

**Additional Assessments** (Available in Portal):
- If client's needs evolve, they can request:
  - Nutrition assessment (if they started with training only)
  - Training assessment (if they started with nutrition only)
  - Youth assessment (if they add family members)
  - Recovery assessment (if they're overtraining)
- These generate NEW packets without leaving the portal

---

## How This Differentiates AFYA

### 1. **Human-First, Not Form-First**
- Other sites: "Fill out this form and buy a program"
- AFYA: "Let's talk first, then we'll customize something for you"

### 2. **Guided Journey, Not Self-Service**
- Other sites: "Pick your program from a menu"
- AFYA: "We'll recommend what's right based on your conversation"

### 3. **Living Relationship, Not One-Time Purchase**
- Other sites: "Here's your PDF, good luck"
- AFYA: "Here's your portal where we'll work together over time"

### 4. **Educational First, Sales Second**
- Free tools demonstrate expertise before asking for commitment
- Builds trust through value, not pressure

### 5. **Adaptive, Not Static**
- Clients can evolve their program as needs change
- Portal grows with them, not locked into initial choice

## Why This Works Better

### For Clients:
- Less overwhelming (one form vs. many)
- Personal attention (call vs. automated)
- Right program match (guided vs. guessing)
- Ongoing support (portal vs. one-time PDF)
- Tools available anytime (no re-visiting public site)

### For AFYA:
- Higher quality leads (conversation vs. form)
- Better conversion (relationship vs. transaction)
- Proper program fit (fewer mismatches)
- Ongoing engagement (portal vs. one-off)
- Differentiated positioning (coaching vs. product)

### For Coaches:
- Context before first session (discovery call notes)
- Appropriate program assignment (not client self-selection)
- Centralized client management (portal vs. scattered)
- Ability to adapt programs (additional assessments)

---

## Migration Path

### What to Do with Existing Intake System:

1. **Keep the Infrastructure**
   - All the intake paths, question blocks, packet generation
   - This is valuable technology

2. **Move It to Portal**
   - Initial intake happens AFTER account creation
   - Triggered by program assignment
   - Additional intakes available on-demand

3. **Simplify Public Entry**
   - One discovery form replaces all public intakes
   - Generates lead, not packet
   - Human review before program assignment

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review & Approve Strategy**
   - Does this align with AFYA's vision?
   - Any adjustments needed?

2. **Create Discovery Form**
   - Simple, friendly, conversation-starting
   - Replaces all current public intakes

3. **Update Programs Page**
   - Remove intake CTAs
   - Add "Schedule Discovery Call" CTAs
   - Enhance program descriptions

4. **Plan Portal Enhancements**
   - First-login experience
   - Portal-based intake flow
   - Additional assessment requests

5. **Train Team**
   - Discovery call process
   - Program recommendation guidelines
   - Portal client onboarding

---

## Questions to Consider

1. **Discovery Call Logistics**
   - Who conducts these? (Admin, specific coach, rotating?)
   - How are they scheduled? (Calendly integration?)
   - What's the follow-up process?

2. **Program Assignment**
   - Who decides which program? (Call conductor, head coach?)
   - Can clients choose after recommendation?
   - What if they want multiple programs?

3. **Pricing Strategy**
   - Discussed on call or shown on site?
   - Different tiers within programs?
   - Package deals for combined programs?

4. **Portal Access Timing**
   - Created during call or after payment?
   - Trial period or commitment required?
   - How to handle "not ready yet" leads?

---

**Bottom Line**: Transform AFYA from "another program website" into "a coaching relationship that starts with a conversation." The technology supports the relationship, not replaces it.
